## About Project 
The burden of chronic disease is impacting not only health services but also having significant socio-economic impact. COVID-19 has highlighted this risk even more. There is a need to have a digital platform to help people with such condition to manage their issues through digital interaction with practitioners and managing daily health and wellbeing routines. It is particularly relevant for people with chronic conditions as normal medical treatment alone is not enough to manage such problems and it needs behavioural and wellness support.
Our current platform provides long term solution for prevention and management of chronic conditions:

The platform gathers medical, nutrition, lifestyle, behaviour data, personal goals data from users through interactive questionnaires and integrated technologies.
Digital access and consultation with medical practitioners are available through the platform. Practitioners can also deliver prescriptions and recommendations digitally on Empeal.
These data points are linked using unique algorithms to deliver health programmes with relevant targets and content for individual end-users.

Users have access to practitioners and it is a gamified platform to ensure higher engagement.
Detailed user level analytics show continuous shift in markers and KPIâ€™s, which in turn enables users and practitioners to focus on key areas for better and quicker results.
